February 16th:
  - Installed Fusion

  - Looked up how some other manufacturers approached this
  - Got a tip from Hans Leeuw about capacitive sensing

  - Made this Log.md and a README.md and added all info

February 25th:
  - Found a mechanism that keeps the key straight wherever you press. (Parallelogram mechanism)
  - Added this mechanism to the prototype list (consists now of 3 designs)
  - Thinking of a possible combination of the 3
