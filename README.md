# JankóMidiPiano #

#### This is a project I started for my Makerskills class at the HKU. ####

##### Concept #####
The idea is to make a midi keyboard with the Jankó layout and some inspiration of other isomorphic keyboards. The keyboard needs the mechanical function like a Jankó or Lippens keyboard. So the notes that are the same will all move down if you push one of them.

##### Jankó layout #####
The Jankó layout was designed in the late 19th century by Paul von Jankó. It was designed as an alternative for the current piano layout that benefits the key of C and is harder to transpose on the fly.
